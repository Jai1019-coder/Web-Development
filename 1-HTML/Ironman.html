        <h1>Iron Man</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
            <img src="Iron Man.jpg" alt="Iron Man" width="400" height="400"><span style="color: red;">Iron Man</span> is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer 
            and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, 
            the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, and received his own title with Iron Man #1 
            in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a superhero team, the Avengers, with 
            Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published 
            consistently since the character's creation.

            Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the 
            company Stark Industries. Beginning his career as a weapons manufacturer, he is captured in a war zone, and 
            his heart is severely injured by shrapnel. To sustain his heart and escape his captors, he builds a technologically 
            advanced armor. After escaping, he continues using the armor as a superhero, creating more advanced models that grant 
            him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was used to explore political 
            themes, and early Iron Man stories were set in the Cold War. Later stories explored other themes, such as civil unrest, 
            technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.

        <h2>Publication History</h2>

        <h3>Premier</h3>
        <p>
            Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of superhero comic books, 
            Marvel set about creating new superhero characters.[1] During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept 
            for Iron Man.[1] Lee was interested in making an unlikeable character likeable, saying that he "thought it 
            would be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like, none of [Marvel's] readers would like, 
            and shove him down their throats and make them like him".[2] Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent 
            arms industry developed in the United States, and this was incorporated into the character's backstory.[3] 
            The character was introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward 
            Vietnam in which Iron Man was created as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that 
            tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil".

        <h3>Solo Series</h3>
        <p>
            In 2008, a film adaptation titled Iron Man was released, starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and 
            directed by Jon Favreau. Iron Man was met with positive reviews from film critics,[179] grossing $318 million 
            domestically and $585 million worldwide, and became the first in the long-running Marvel Cinematic Universe.
            [180] Downey's casting was praised, as was his portrayal of the character; Downey's own recovery from substance 
            abuse was seen as creating a personal connection with the character.[181] Downey reprises his role in Iron 
            Man 2 (2010), Marvel's The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: 
            Civil War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).
            [182][183] Downey's character was retired following his appearance in Avengers: Endgame, but Iron Man supporting 
            characters continue in their own Marvel Cinematic Universe titles, Ironheart and Armor Wars.[

        <h2>Fictional Character Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Tony Stark inherited his family's business, Stark Industries, after his parents were killed in a car crash.
            [65] Developing equipment for the U.S. military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when 
            he triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist 
            Wong-Chu, who demands that Stark build him a weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his 
            heart, becoming Iron Man.[15][5] The war zone that Stark visits has been changed multiple times by different 
            writers to correspond with the character's age, which is explained by a "sliding scale of continuity" in 
            which the timing of significant events in the world of Marvel may change. For the first decades of Iron Man's 
            publication history, the conflict is the Vietnam War.[66] This was changed retroactively in the 1990s to an 
            unnamed Southeast Asian country,[67] and a conflict in the fictional country of Siancong was eventually established 
            to justify the inconsistency.[68]
